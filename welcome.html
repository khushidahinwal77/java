        <h1>About Java</h1>
        <p>
            Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Java was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle) and released in 1995. It is one of the most popular programming languages in use, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.
